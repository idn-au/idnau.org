    <p>Vocabularies are the programmatic communication of a common language used in your data or metadata to provide unambiguous meaning. Further, a vocabulary presented in a standard format is a crucial part of making machine-to-machine data sharing possible.</p>
    <p>A vocabulary can be as simple as a glossary with unique terms and corresponding definitions that anyone in the community can have access to. They can also contain synonyms, intra-vocabulary relationships and cross-vocabulary mappings. Examples of publicly available vocabularies can be found at the <a href="https://vocabs.ardc.edu.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ARDC Research Vocabularies Australia</a>.</p>
