    <a href="https://idn-au.github.io/idn-metadata-creator/#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Metadata Entry Tool</a>
    <p>In order to catalogue Indigenous data, the metadata describing the data needs to be collected and stored in a standardised way - as outlined on the <RouterLink to="/resources/characterisingindigenousdata">Characterising Indigenous Data</RouterLink> page and explained in the <a href="https://w3id.org/idn/def/cp/guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Metadata Profile</a>.</p>
    <p>The Metadata Entry Tool allows you to complete the information required for describing the Indigenous Data to be <a href="http://idn.kurrawong.net/catalog/democat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">catalogued</a> and to see how your entered information meets FAIR data principles. This information can then be saved and shared in a machine-readable standard for describing web resources and data interchange known as Resource Description Framework or RDF. There are a number of attributes that must be completed but it is hoped that all attributes will be completed to give a fuller description of the data.</p>
