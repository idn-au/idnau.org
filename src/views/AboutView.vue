    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
        The Indigenous Data Network (IDN) is a national network of Aboriginal community-controlled organisations, university research partners, Indigenous businesses and government agencies and departments. It is led by a Steering Committee of experts and stakeholders and the founding partnership between the University of Melbourne, the Australian National University and the Australian Institute for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS).
    </p>
    <p>
        The IDN was established to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>empower Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities to decide their own local data priorities, including how their data is used, and </li>
        <li>ensure those decisions are supported and reinforced by national legal and policy frameworks, the FAIR and CARE data principles, as well as the principles of Indigenous data democracy, stewardship, analysis, dissemination and infrastructure.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Improving Indigenous Research Capabilities project</h3>
    <p>
        Led by the IDN and comprised of partnerships with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander researchers, organisations and communities across Australia, the Improving Indigenous Research Capabilities (IIRC) project reviewed and refined national and international frameworks of Indigenous Data Governance (IDG) and Indigenous Data Sovereignty (IDS). The project received co-investment from the Australian Research Data Commons (<a href="doi.org/10.3565/pr3g-s109" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">doi.org/10.3565/pr3g-s109</a> & <a href="doi.org/10.47486/HIR003" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">doi.org/10.47486/HIR003</a>) from the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC) through the HASS and Indigenous Research Data Commons. The ARDC is enabled by the Australian Government's National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS).
