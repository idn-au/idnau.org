# IDN Website
This is the new website for the Indigenous Data Network, using [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com) and [NuxtContent](https://content.nuxt.com) for rendering Markdown for each page.

## Contributing Content
Pages are located in the `/content` directory and are written in Markdown. The files in this directory create the routing, i.e. each page in `/content` is a page on the website, and the nesting of folders are reflected in the routing.

Ordinary Markdown syntax can be used in these files to write page content. For a starter guide to writing Markdown, see [markdownguide](https://www.markdownguide.org). Components in the `/components/content/` directory can be referenced in Markdown.

See [NuxtContent Markdown docs](https://content.nuxt.com/usage/markdown) for more info on how to use Markdown in Nuxt.
