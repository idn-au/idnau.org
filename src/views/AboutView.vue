    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>The Indigenous Data Network (IDN) is maintained within the University of Melbourne. It was established in 2018 to
        support and coordinate the governance of Indigenous data for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and
        empower Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities to decide their own local data priorities.</p>
    <p>The IDN is a national network of Aboriginal community-controlled organisations, university research partners,
        Indigenous businesses and government agencies and departments led by a Steering Committee of experts and
        stakeholders and the founding partnership between the University of Melbourne, the Australian National
        University and the Australian Institute for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS). </p>
    <h2>The Catalogue Project</h2>
    <p>The Catalogue Project is part of the much larger <a

            target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Improving Indigenous Research Capabilities (IIRC) Project</a>

        with the following outcomes expected:
    <ul>
        <li>The development of an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Research Data Catalogue. This includes
            vocabulary development and metadata labelling; incorporating Institutional Traditional Knowledge and
            Biocultural Knowledge labels will be investigated.</li>
        <li>Geospatial portal supporting development of an Indigenous Loc-I (<a

                rel="noopener noreferrer">Location Index framework</a>)</li>
        <li>Improved understanding of Indigenous Research data across Australia.</li>
        <li>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander data 'rematriation' prototyping.</li>
        <li>The technical architecture will be based on a catalogue of data assets using DCAT, the international
            standard for interoperability between data catalogues published on the Web.</li>
    </ul>
