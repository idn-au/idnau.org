## What is Indigenous Data?
Indigenous data encompasses a broad and evolving category of information that reflects the lived experiences, knowledge systems, and governance priorities of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. The Indigenous Data Network (IDN) defines Indigenous data as:

*Data generated, intentionally or not, by, about, or for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Indigenous data refers to information, in any format or medium, collected, analysed, stored, and interpreted within the context of Indigenous individuals, collectives, populations, entities, lifeways, cultures, knowledge systems, lands, biodiversity, water and other resources. It includes data collected, used, or stored by any agency, department, laboratory, organisation, corporation, statutory body, university or research institute, conducted by, with, and about Indigenous people or people, and data that Indigenous communities have generated and maintained themselves.
