# Community Data Research Project
The Indigenous Data Network has partnered with three Aboriginal Community Controlled Organisations (ACCO’s) for the Community Data Project to gain a better understanding of the unique data requirements and data ecosystems of community-led organisations. The urban, regional and remote settings of our partners in South-East Queensland, the East-Kimberley Western Australia, and the NPY Lands in the tri-state region of South Australia, the Northern Territory and Western Australia, provide a diverse context and population base to develop these understandings. This project supports the achievement of CtG Priority Reform Four. More broadly, this project will strengthen local data governance and data sovereignty efforts, enabling Indigenous people to develop, access and make use of their own data in ways that are both locally relevant and useful for their communities.

Our project partners are: 

- Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Service (ATSICHS) Brisbane 
- Ngaanyatjarra Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Women’s Council (NPYWC)
- Binarri-binyja yarawoo, Empowered Communities - East Kimberley 

The research is being carried out via five core focus areas:  

1. Data ecosystem mapping and analysis
2. Capacity building and improving data management
3. Data access and identification of data linkages 
4. Development of policy recommendations and advocacy 
5. Dissemination of research findings among research partners and stakeholders
