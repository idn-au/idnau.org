    <h2>FAIR, CARE, TK and Indigenous Data Governance</h2>
    <p>The IDN Catalogue Project will leverage Indigenous Data Network and ARDC capabilities and research in creating programmatic applications for FAIR and CARE scoring of metadata records. 
    <br>
    It will also seek to include <a href="https://localcontexts.org/notices/aboutnotices/" target="_blank">Traditional and Biocultural Knowledge Notices and Labels</a> that institutions and researchers can request, to apply to their metadata records.</p>
    <p>Outcomes include supporting institutions to manage and share data more freely and cooperatively following the principles of:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) and </li>
        <li>CARE (Collective benefit, Authority to control, Responsibility and Ethics), </li>
        <li>Traditional Knowledge (TK) Labels and </li>
        <li><a href="https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/indigenous-data-governance-for-the-21st-century" target="_blank">Indigenous Data Governance</a>. See also STREAM 1 project information.</li>

The authors intended to provide guidelines to improve the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse of digital assets. </p>
                    <p>The full principles are set out in full on the <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/" target="_blank">GO FAIR</a> website. ARDC also offers comprehensive <a href="https://ardc.edu.au/resource/fair-data/" target="_blank">information and training</a>. The FAIR Principles refer to three types of entities: data, metadata and infrastructure.

                    <p><a href="https://localcontexts.org/" target="_blank">Local Contexts</a> was founded in 2010 to support Indigenous communities to manage their intellectual and cultural property, cultural heritage, environmental data and genetic resources within digital environments.</p>
                    <p>This initiative offers digital strategies for Indigenous communities, cultural institutions and researchers through the TK (Traditional Knowledge) and BC (Biocultural) Labels and Notices. Together they function as a practical mechanism to advance aspirations for Indigenous data sovereignty and Indigenous innovation.</p>
                    <p>The IDN Catalogue Project is investigating ways to programmatically indicate to legacy indigenous data holders the appropriate labels and notices that could be applied to their metadata. Whilst there are many traditional knowledge and biocultural knowledge labels that can be applied by Indigenous Data Custodians, this project is only concerned with the application of the following four notices:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>TK (Traditional Knowledge) Notice</li>
                        <li>BC (Biocultural) Notice</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>And the two Institution Notices</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Attribution Incomplete Notice</li>
                        <li>Open to Collaboration Notice.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The Notices are a mechanism for researchers and institutional staff to identify Indigenous collections and Indigenous interests in data.</p>
                    <p>The Notices can function as place-holders on collections, data, or in a sample field until a TK or a BC Label is added by a community.</p>
                    <p>In order to apply these notices, you need to register for the Local Contexts Hub <a href="https://localcontexts.org/tk-label-hub/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
