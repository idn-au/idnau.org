    <h2>Finding Indigenous Data</h2>
    <p>The aims of the IDN Catalogue Project are to develop a technical architecture as the foundation for an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Research Data Commons, build an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Spatio-temporal Framework around core National Indigenous Data Assets and develop data 'rematiration' prototyping.</p>
    <p>This work goes toward enabling the finding of Indigenous data, supporting institutions to share data more freely and cooperatively following the <RouterLink to="/resources/faircare">FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) and CARE data principles (Collective benefit, Authority to control, Responsibility and Ethics)</RouterLink>.</p>
    <p>Discovery of any data programmatically requires standard metadata and well described vocabularies. The beta IDN Catalogue is implementing the following and encourages feedback on the words and meanings used. </p>
