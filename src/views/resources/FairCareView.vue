    <h2>FAIR, CARE, TK and Indigenous Data Governance</h2>
    <p>The IDN Catalogue Project will leverage Indigenous Data Network and ARDC capabilities and research in creating programmatic applications for FAIR and CARE scoring of metadata records. 
    <br>
    It will also seek to include <a href="https://localcontexts.org/notices/aboutnotices/" target="_blank">Traditional and Biocultural Knowledge Notices and Labels</a> that institutions and researchers can request, to apply to their metadata records.</p>
    <p>Outcomes include supporting institutions to manage and share data more freely and cooperatively following the principles of:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) and </li>
        <li>CARE (Collective benefit, Authority to control, Responsibility and Ethics), </li>
        <li>Traditional Knowledge (TK) Labels and </li>
        <li><a href="https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/indigenous-data-governance-for-the-21st-century" target="_blank">Indigenous Data Governance</a>. See also STREAM 1 project information.</li>
    </ul>

                    <p>In 2016, the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18" target="_blank">'FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship'</a> were published in Scientific Data. The authors intended to provide guidelines to improve the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse of digital assets. </p>
                    <p>The full principles are set out in full on the <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/" target="_blank">GO FAIR</a> website. ARDC also offers comprehensive <a href="https://ardc.edu.au/resource/fair-data/" target="_blank">information and training</a>. 
                    <br>
                    The FAIR Principles refer to three types of entities: data, metadata and infrastructure.
