Professor Marcia Langton AO, PhD, is a distinguished anthropologist, geographer, and academic renowned for her groundbreaking work in Indigenous studies. Descended from the Yiman and Bidjara nations of Queensland, Langton has dedicated her career to advocating for the rights and recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.  

Langton's journey into advocacy began in 1977 when she assumed the role of General Secretary of the Federal Council for Advancement of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People. This marked the beginning of a lifelong commitment to advancing Indigenous rights. During the 1980s, Langton pursued her studies at the Australian National University, where she honed her expertise in anthropology.  

Following her academic pursuits, Langton spent five years as an anthropologist with the Central Land Council in Alice Springs, where she conducted crucial research into Indigenous land rights. Her involvement in the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody from 1989 to 1992 further solidified her position as a leading voice in Indigenous advocacy.  

Langton's contributions to policy and legislation are profound, notably her instrumental role in the passage of the Native Title Act in 1993. Throughout her illustrious career, she has held esteemed academic positions, including Ranger Professor of Aboriginal Studies at the Northern Territory University and the Foundation Chair of Australian Indigenous Studies at the University of Melbourne.  

Beyond academia, Langton's impact extends into public policy, evidenced by her participation in initiatives such as the Empowered Communities project and the Expert Panel on Constitutional Recognition of Indigenous Australians. A prolific author, she has published extensively on topics ranging from Aboriginal land tenure to art and film. Langton's latest book, "Law: The Way of the Ancestors," co-authored with Professor Aaron Corn, continues to enrich scholarly discourse on Indigenous issues.
