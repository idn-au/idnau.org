Metadata Entry Tool
::

In order to catalogue Indigenous data, the metadata describing the data needs to be collected and stored in a standardised way - as outlined on the [Characterising Indigenous Data](/resources/characterisingindigenousdata)  page and explained in the [Metadata Profile](https://data.idnau.org/pid/cp/guide).

The Metadata Entry Tool allows you to complete the information required for describing the Indigenous Data to be [catalogued](https://data.idnau.org) and to see how your entered information meets FAIR data principles. This information can then be saved and shared in a machine-readable standard for describing web resources and data interchange known as Resource Description Framework or RDF. There are a number of attributes that must be completed but it is hoped that all attributes will be completed to give a fuller description of the data.
