In this project the [W3C recommended Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT) - Version 2](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-2/), which is a metadata model, has been extended to include the Indigenous Data Characteristics being trialled (see the [Metadata Entry Tool](/resources/met)).

These standard characteristics are then used to:
- mandate a minimum set of metadata elements related to Indigenous Data Governance and Sovereignty
- allow for the modelling of certain Agent (person and organisation) roles in relation to data important for Indigenous Governance
- provide mappings from DCAT metadata to data rating systems such as those for FAIR and CARE Principles.
