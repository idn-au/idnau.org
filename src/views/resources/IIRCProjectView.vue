    <h3>About the Improving Indigenous Research Capabilities Project</h3>
    <p>Representing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander researchers, organisations and communities across Australia, this project will apply national and international frameworks of Indigenous Data Governance (IDG) and Indigenous Data Sovereignty (IDS) to collectively strengthen the foundations of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander data governance principles, which will be translated and applied to Indigenous research data tools and infrastructure.</p>
    <p>The program will achieve this by working with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities to determine their engagement with, and aspirations for, their data. The program will be delivered by the development of three parallel streams of activities:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Development of social architecture: Indigenous data governance and sovereignty</li>
        <li>Development of technical architecture: Building the foundations for an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Research Data Commons</li>
        <li>Core National Indigenous Data Assets: Building an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Spatio-temporal Framework.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Collectively, the three activity streams will lay the foundation to build national Indigenous research capabilities, framed by a set of agreed Indigenous Data Governance principles that can leverage existing data assets, linking them with new and existing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander data assets. This project will generate a detailed account of research data ecosystems, including how research data is distributed and used for the benefit of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The IIRC project is one of four activity streams of the ARDC's HASS Research Data Commons program.</p>
    <p>The core objectives of the Indigenous Research Capability program are to:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>collectively agree on, and apply, a set of uniquely Australian, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Data Governance Principles;</li>
        <li>enable Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations and researchers to manage their data sustainably;</li>
        <li>establish the breadth and depth of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander research data available across Australia that are relevant to the needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples;</li>
        <li>develop the foundations of an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Data Commons; and</li>
        <li>value adding through access to appropriate aggregation and analysis tools.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><em>The project framework embeds Indigenous Data Governance and Sovereignty across all streams of activities.</em></p>
