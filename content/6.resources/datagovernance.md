# Indigenous Data Governance
The IDN Catalogue Project will be informed by the key deliverables from Stream 1 of the Improving Indigenous Research Capabilities project.

An Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Research Data Commons ([PDF](https://test.idnau.org/reports/ardc/2021/11/Indigenous-Research-Capability-Revised-project-plan-Oct-2021.pdf)) is "to agree on a set of core, and uniquely Australian, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Data Governance principles that will inform and be applied to all other streams and activities of this project."

The IDN Catalogue Project is trialling data characterisation, profiling metadata and creating vocabularies to embed Indigenous data governance and sovereignty elements for discovery, access and use where it exists and where it could exist in the future.
