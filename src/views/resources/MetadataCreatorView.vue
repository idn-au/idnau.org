    <p>In order to catalogue Indigenous data, the metadata describing the data needs to be collected and stored in a standardised way - as outlined on the <RouterLink to="/characterisingindigenousdata">Characterising Indigenous Data</RouterLink> page.</p>
    <p>The Metadata Creator Tool allows you to complete the information required for describing the Indigenous Data to be <a href="https://w3id.org/idn/resource/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">catalogued</a> and to see how your entered information meets FAIR data principles. This information can then be saved and shared in a machine-readable standard for describing web resources and data interchange known as Resource Description Framework or RDF. There are a number of attributes that must be completed but it is hoped that all attributes will be completed to give a fuller description of the data.</p>
