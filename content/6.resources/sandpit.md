# Sandpit in the Sandstone
Sandpit in the Sandstone is a collaborative initiative between The University of Queensland and The University of Melbourne, funded by the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC). This partnership aims to enhance Indigenous research capabilities by improving research data commons, with a focus on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander collections held at The University of Queensland's galleries, libraries, archives, and museums. Initially led by Associate Professor Sandra Phillips, Dr Penny Holliday, and Dr Toni McPherson, the project team has evolved in 2024 to include Professor Annemaree Carroll as manager, Dr Penny Holliday as co-lead and Project Manager, and Dr Amberyn Thomas from UQ Library. The project maintains its partnership with the Mithaka Aboriginal Corporation, underlining its commitment to Indigenous collaboration and research improvement.
