    <h2>Characterising Indigenous Data</h2>
    <p>Characterising Indigenous data is the process of discovering, analysing and scoping data requirements and then representing and communicating (delivering) these data requirements in a precise form based on a model. The process is iterative and will include a conceptual, logical and physical model.</p>
    <p>Using characterisations based on existing well known standards provides a common vocabulary and understanding around the data and systems using them. These vocabulary can also be given alternate labels should the community determine the standard naming is not sufficient, without affecting the interoperability of the system.</p>
